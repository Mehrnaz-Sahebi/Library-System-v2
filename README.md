# Library System

The Library System is a comprehensive application that simulates the basic functionality of a library management system. It allows you to add various resources (books, theses, selling books, etc.), manage users (students, staff, managers), borrow and return resources, as well as generate reports. The system also supports managing user comments and penalties. This project was developed for my Advanced Programming course.

- Add and remove users (students, staff, managers)
